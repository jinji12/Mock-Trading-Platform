Title: Mock Stock Trading Platform

Project Description: I am creating a program that generates a user interface for a stock management system similar to a rudimentary version of Robinhood. 
Users can connect to the software using a username and password, build their own portfolio, link their accounts, and perform various actions. When logged
in, users can add stocks to their portfolio by specifying the stock symbol, price, and quantity. They can also deposit money into their portfolio, withdraw
funds to their imaginary bank account, view their available buying power, and see the current value of their portfolio. Additionally, users can remove stocks
from their portfolio, log out, and export their entire portfolio as a CSV file.

Reflection:

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, despite the challenges it presented. One particularly difficult aspect was figuring out how to store all the 
users' data efficiently, which took a significant amount of time. Additionally, ensuring that the program could handle edge case inputs was also time-consuming.
However, it was incredibly rewarding to see the final product come together. Unfortunately, I was unable to implement a feature where stock prices change randomly,
but I have plans to expand the project in the future. Looking back, I realize that planning ahead and exploring potential systems before diving into the project 
would have saved me time and made implementing features more efficient. It would have been beneficial to research different data storage options and consider the
overall architecture of the program. Nonetheless, this project has provided me with valuable learning experiences, and I am excited to continue developing it further.
