Title: Mock Stock Trading Platform

Project Description: I intend to create a program that generates a user interface for a 
stock management system similar to a very rudimentary version of Robinhood. Users will
be able to connect to the software using a username and password, building their own 
portfolio to which their accounts will be linked. When logged in, users can add stocks
to their portfolio using the stock symbol, price, and quantity, deposit money into 
their portfolio, withdraw money back into their imaginary bank account, see available
buying power, and see portfolio value. They can also remove stocks from their portfolio,
log out, and get an output of a CSV file of thier entire portfolio.

Reflection: 
I throughly enjoyed working on this project, despite the challenges it presented.
One particularly difficult aspect was figuring out how to store all the users' data
together, which ended up taking a significatn amount of time. Additionally, ensuring
that the program could handle edge case inputs was also time-consuming. Despite this,
it was incredibly rewarding to see the final product come together. Unfortunatly, I was 
unable to add a feature where stock prices would change randomly, but I have plans to 
expand the project in the future, such as by integrating a stock API or adding a large 
file of stock data. I realize that planning ahead and exploring potential systems before
diving into the project would have saved me time and made implementing features more
efficient. Overall, I found this project to be a avaluable learning experience and 
looking forward to further developing it.
